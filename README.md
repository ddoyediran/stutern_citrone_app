# Citrone Project Application

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo. Run `git clone git@github.com:ddoyediran/stutern_citrone_app.git`

2. cd to the project directory `stutern_citrone_app`

3. To install all the dependencies and dev-dependencies needed, run `npm install`

4. Create a new branch off the main branch. You can name the branch like this "yourName_dev_branch e.g `git checkout -b divine_dev_branch`.

\*\*\* Please don't write (push) your code to the main branch.

5. Create .env file on the root folder to have `MONGODB_URI` and `PORT` etc.

6. Delete `.gitkeep` file in some of the directory.

7. Don't forget to build the feature(s) one at time, remember to test the feature and that it is working before you push to github.

8. Run `git pull origin main` to make sure your branch has the same update/ code with the main branch on github before you start working on new feature(s), to prevent your `yourName_dev_branch` from having several commits behind the main branch.

##### Note: README.md will get constant update, keep an eye on this file
